# UPSI Next Generation Software
## Laboratory Management System

This is the start of a project that I was going to do for a client of mine when I had my own company.  This system was intended to completely overhaul a "circa 1980s" system (dBaseIV, Foxpro, etc) to a modern WPF Desktop application.  My intention was to have it  integrate with the website that I also built for them.  Unfortunately, the client decided not to go forward with the idea.  

#### Note that I did all this work on my own time and completely unpaid. 

### I am showing this to you to demonstrate that I am passionate about software development, and that I have no problem learning what it takes to get the job done.  At the time I was developing this project I was teaching myself the principles of the MVVM design pattern and WPF.

Keep in mind, this is not a complete solution, just a start.  Yet I still have quite a bit of work in it.  You will note most of the work is in the Utilities projects.  Those were the projects that I was writing to aid in converting their existing Foxpro database to a SQL database, while at the same time building a "standardized metadata" system based on the existing "free-form" data they were working with.  I was working hard trying to make the conversion of their existing database as streamlined, easy for the users, and accurate as possible.
